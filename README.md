# GravyLang
A spare time project where I attempt to create a programming language

Todo:
Lexer (single line)
  1. Create a sub-class of delimiter where the post and pre regex is predefined as non-word characters.
  2. do that same for single character delimiters.
  3. tokenizer functionality
Lexer (Multi line)
  1. Create handler for text file and multi line input that utilises single line lexer

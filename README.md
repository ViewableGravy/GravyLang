# GravyLang
A spare time project where I attempt to create a programming language

Todo:
Lexer (single line)
  1. Handle numbers with decimal places
  1. Create a sub-class of delimiter where the post and pre regex is predefined as non-word characters.
  2. do that same for single character delimiters.
  3. Auto sort delimiters by largest to smallest on initialisation of class
  4. tokenizer functionality (partial implementation)
  5. add more delimiters and coverage
  6. add test coverage for new lexer
Lexer (Multi line)
  1. Create handler for text file and multi line input that utilises single line lexer
